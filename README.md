# mess-meal-sheet

This is a excel sheet I created when I was mess manager to organize and control everything. This sheet may need some work as per user need. 

#working mechanics
- counts meal from Sat - Thu
    - (0.5 = 1 meal) = morning
    - (1 = 1 meal) = Day
    - (1 = 1 meal) = Night
 
- Friday
  - (2 = 1 meal) + 2 (kitchen worker bonus) = Day
  - others same.
 
- The routine checking system may need some work.

I am done with this project. So maybe will not work on this anymore if not needed. customize as you like.
